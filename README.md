# Data Journalism Portfolio

Below you will find my final portfolio of data journalism projects, including Data Visualizations and Data Storytelling.

## About Me and This Portfolio

My name is Hallie Fuchs and I am a scientific journalism major at Lehigh University with a minor in Health, Medicine and Society. I care very deeply about the health of both the environment and people. I will be launching a travel/lifestyle blog to promote living a life of wellness and happiness. I am also a very skilled photographer and videographer and have trained with National Geographic professionals. 

It is my personal philosophy that every person should care about their own health, both mental and physical, as well as protect the environment we are living in. I also have a passion for marine biology and conservation, therefore some of the projects below reflect that theme.

# MARINE DEBRIS

This infographic displays some data on a very important issue to me personally – marine debris. I created this infographic using Canva with data from [PERSEUS](PERSEUS-NET.EU)

# The History of Happiness

This interactive timeline I created serves as a taste of where the concept of happiness came from, how it developed into a lifestyle, and how it continues to put smiles on people's faces thousands of years later.

# Toxic Chemical Release in the State of Hawaii

This chart I created with Chartbuilder displays the pounds of toxic chemicals (specifically TRI chemicals) released into the environment per year over a ten year period. TRI chemicals are chemicals produced and then disposed of by manufacturing companies such as automobile, clothing, or even pharmacutical companies. 

The [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis) has decided to regualte and collect data on the disposal of these toxic chemicals due to their potential to harm the health humans, animals, or the environment. This particular chart focuses on chemicals released on land, into the ocean, and into the air in the state of Hawaii, which is ranked 40/56 states or territories for total releases per square mile (Rank 1 = highest releases). 

Over this ten year period, Hawaii's total releases of TRIs have decreased but land and water releases specifically have increased. The overall trend for air emissions has decreased consistently throughout the time period. Check out this [video from the EPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=p9y18YUVL9w) to learn more about TRI emissions.

# Undergraduate Marine Science Programs in the United States

This map I created using Google Fusion shows almost every undergraduate marine biology / marine science programs in the United States. When I was a sophomore at Lehigh, I took a marine science class during my study abroad program in Bermuda. I fell in love with the subject and looked into taking classes at a nearby university to count towards my Lehigh degree. I was dissapointed, however, to discover that the only universities that offered marine science classes were far away (near the coast). 

I became curious about whether any other land-locked states around the country had the same lack of marine science programs. After creating this map, I was surprised and intruiged to discover that almost every marine science program around the country was offered at a university directly on the coast. 

It makes sense – students are able to get hands-on experience by studying in an environment close to the water. I believe, however, that students attending universities that are not directly on the coast should have an oppertunity to learn marine science too. Marine science is a hugely important field of study as climate change grows to be more and more of an impending threat to our planet. In addition, students living in land-locked states (such as Pennsylvania) should know that they may have to travel to a distant university in order to study marine science.

# Interactive Map on Drug Overdose in the United States

I created this map using Tableau to allow my readers to interact with data on drug overdose deaths in the United States. The data was very complex and hard to understand, so my map allows readers to click through three different years of data using the "year" tool. I used different colours to seperate the types of drug overdose deaths by type of drug so that my visualization was easy to look through and comprehend. 

With such a heavy subject like death from drug overdose, it would have been easier to create a bland bar or line graph. Instead, I wanted readers to be able to interact with the data and get a sense of the severity of the issue in a hands-on way. It is a very important topic in schools and programs around the world and I would like my readers to feel like they have learned something, possibly something about the place they live, after viewing my visualization.

# Undergraduate Enrollment at Lehigh University 

This bar chart displays the percent of undergraduate students at Lehigh University enrolled in each college (2016). I created this visualization using chartbuilder, data courtesy of The Office of Institutional Research at Lehigh.

# Undergraduate Enrollment at Lehigh University by College 

This line graph tracks the total number of undergraduate students enrolled in the Arts and Science, Bussiness, and Engineering colleges over a ten year period at Lehigh Univeristy. I made this graph using Chartbuilder. I predicted that each line would have a growth trend, but in reality the trends varied depending on the year.
