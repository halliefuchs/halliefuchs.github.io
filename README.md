# Undergraduate Enrollment at Lehigh University 

This bar chart displays the percent of undergraduate students at Lehigh University enrolled in each college (2016). I created this visualization using chartbuilder, data courtesy of The Office of Institutional Research at Lehigh.

# Undergraduate Enrollment at Lehigh University by College 

This line graph tracks the total number of undergraduate students enrolled in the Arts and Science, Bussiness, and Engineering colleges over a ten year period at Lehigh Univeristy. I made this graph using Chartbuilder. I predicted that each line would have a growth trend, but in reality the trends varied depending on the year.

# Toxic Chemical Release in the State of Hawaii

This chart I created with Chartbuilder displays the pounds of toxic chemicals (specifically TRI chemicals) released into the environment per year over a ten year period. TRI chemicals are chemicals produced and then disposed of by manufacturing companies such as automobile, clothing, or even pharmacutical companies. 

The [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis) has decided to regualte and collect data on the disposal of these toxic chemicals due to their potential to harm the health humans, animals, or the environment. This particular chart focuses on chemicals released on land, into the ocean, and into the air in the state of Hawaii, which is ranked 40/56 states or territories for total releases per square mile (Rank 1 = highest releases). 

Over this ten year period, Hawaii's total releases of TRIs have decreased but land and water releases specifically have increased. Watch this [video from the EPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=p9y18YUVL9w) to learn more about TRI emissions.
